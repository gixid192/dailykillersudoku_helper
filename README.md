This is userscript which basically just a script file, you will need an environment to run this file. The keyword is "Running userscipt on insert_your_device"
1. For computers
- I myself use tampermonkey: https://www.tampermonkey.net/
2. For mobiles/tablets
- I use Safari as main web browser for my phone, this is the extension that supports userscript: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887
- I also tested on my Android. We need a browser that supports userscript, or has the ability to install extensions that support userscript. I used both [violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) and tampermonkey on Android
  + Kiwi browser works but at the time writing this, it seemed to discontinued developing
  + Edge of Microsoft works: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.emmx
  + Soul browser supports userscript out of the box: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycompany.app.soulbrowser
  + Others? I don't know, you need to check it yourself.
# Known bugs
- Sometimes it removes/disables the combinations in serveral cases out of blue, I have no idea when it happens, how it happens; everytime I tried to fix it, it always back to normal when I open my debugger
- The red-highlighted digits when entering wrong numbers sometimes showing wrong, it rares but it does happen
# What I will NOT do?
- I won't support you get this script running on your phone, you figure out yourself.
- This is a personal script, I built it for myself, and it's in its completeness at the moment, I won't take feature requests. However, PRs are welcome.
